* Correct points2image dependency
  This is not incomplete because point2image has cycle dependency.
* Unify how to receive /image_raw
  In order to use both rgb8 and bayer image format of /image_raw
* Modify launch files to specify source camera
* KLT based Multi Tracking
  -Added Launch file access from RTM
  -Modified ImageViewer to show circles instead of rectangles
* Klt Code Re arranging.
* Make image source selectable from launch file
  In order to use multiple camera, I modified
  - all viewers
  - some cv_tracker's packages and a library
  - lane_detector package
  - some road_wizard package
  so that input image topic can be changed easily from launch file
* KLT based Multi Tracking
  -Added Launch file access from RTM
  -Modified ImageViewer to show circles instead of rectangles
* modified scan2image and calibration_test for calibration_publisher
* Use c++11 option instead of c++0x
  We can use newer compilers which support 'c++11' option
* Klt Code Re arranging.
* Make pointCloud topic selectable subscribed in points_image_viewer
* Modified image_d_viewe to make subscribed topic name being selectable
* fix-dependency
* Modified viewers to make them resizable and to make close button enable
* Initial commit for public release
* Contributors: AMC, Hiroki Ohta, Manato Hirabayashi, Shinpei Kato, Syohei YOSHIDA, USUDA Hisashi, Yukihiro Saito, yukikitsukawa
