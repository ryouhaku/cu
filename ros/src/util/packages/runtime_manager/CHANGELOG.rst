  To take advantage of cuDNN, at least CUDA 7.0 and a GPU with 3.5 compute capability is required.
  -Compile Caffe, located in caffe-fast-rcnn.
  Complete the requisites:http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html
  -Download the pretrained models:
  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/fast-rcnn-data/voc12_submission.tgz
  -Modify the CMakeFiles and point them to your caffe and models directories.
